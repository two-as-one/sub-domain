## Game mechanics

allow player to grapple (DOM)
allow enemies to submit

introduce 'submissiveness' stat to entities
 - reduces the likelihood that the enemy will force submit the player
 - increases the likelihood that they will accept sex

add dom/sub to sexual positions
certain enemies may be more likely to accept one or the other

add dom/sub stat to player, grants access to different positions. changes as the player behaves more in one or the other way

perks:
anal womb - ...?
conjoined twin - it's an npc you can talk to while at camp, any action using mouth deals double lust, changes masturbate options
Dom - replaces 'submit' with 'Dom' - allows the player to choose which parts to submit
    - adds option to change position


temperature affects armor?

enemies:
spunk elemental
bone soldier

nipple penetration perk/position

Gifts:
- Gifts are like perks except that they are gained by other means
- They can immediately grow/remove parts and prevent them from being removed or growing in the future

Shrines:
- Rare encounters when exploring
- Player can choose to pray to receive a `gift`
- Gifts should unlock things that the player would normally not have access to, ie: `hyper shrine`

## areas

## BUGS
 - fix masturbate encounter

## automated testing

## challenge rating
instead of [LVL], show challenge rating in combat

trivial > easy > challenging > difficult > impossible


## design choices
redesign intro - bring power back to the player, group professions so they grant bonuses to multiple stats
whenever an npc uses him/her for the player, allow the player to correct the npc to use the right gender (this updates the gender of the player, instead of needing an options menu)

## discrepancy between submitting and force submit
it's possible for the opponent to reject submit and then immediately force submit the player
should be more like a switch instead of having randomness involved
this also allows it to be used as a formula for displaying chance
